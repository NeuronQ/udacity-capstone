# Report

## I. Definition [1-2 pages]

### Project overview [1-2 paragraphs]
Student provides a high-level overview of the project in laymanâ€™s terms. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is given.

### Problem statement [2-4 paragraphs]
The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made.

### Metrics [0.5-1 pages]
Metrics used to measure performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics are justified based on the characteristics of the problem.

- RMSE
- DACC @ #


## II. Analysis [2-4 pages]

### Data exploration [1 page]
If a dataset is present, features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed, along with a sampling of the data. In lieu of a dataset, a thorough description of the input space or input data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified.

### Exploratory Visualization [2 page]
A visualization has been provided that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data with thorough discussion. Visual cues are clearly defined.
